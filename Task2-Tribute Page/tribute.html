                Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician
                who lived during the British Rule in India. 
                Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, 
                he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis,
                number theory, infinite series,and continued fractions, including 
                solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.

                ☛ Srinivasa Ramanujan born Srinivasa Ramanujan
                Aiyangar 22 December 1887 Erode, Madras Presidency, 
                British India And died in 26 April 1920 (aged 32)<br><br> 

                ☛ Srinivasa Ramanujan became one of the youngest Fellows 
                of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member,
                and the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge <br><br>

                (Bachelor of Arts by Research, 1916<br><br> 

                ☛ Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research
                in isolation: according to Hans Eysenck: "He tried to interest 
                the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed 
                for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, 
                and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered".
                <br><br> 
                
                ☛ Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, 
                in 1913 he began a postal correspondence with the English 
                mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. 
                Recognising Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for 
                him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan 
                had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that 
                "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like
                them before", and some recently proven but highly advanced results.</strong>
                <br><br> 
                
                ☛ Along with Hardy, he worked on the partition function P(n) and gave 
                a non-convergent asymptotic series which allows precise computation of the 
                number of partitions of an integer.The work helped in finding asymptotic formulae,
                called the circle method.

                ☛ Ramanujan was plagued by health problems throughout his life. 
                His health worsened in England. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and 
                a severe vitamin deficiency, and was confined to a sanatorium.
                He returned to Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency in 1919 and died soon thereafter 
                at the age of 32 in 1920. His widow, S. Janaki Ammal, moved to Bombay.
                She returned to Chennai (formerly Madras) in 1950, where she lived until her death at age 95 in 1994
